# cli-commands Specification

## Purpose

The hejbro CLI's user-facing commands as contracts: what each command
does, when it refuses to run, and what its report must tell the user.
Currently covers `baseline`, the command that adopts a database hejbro
did not create by emitting an ordinary first migration that must be
registered as applied rather than run.

## Requirements

### Requirement: A database hejbro did not create can be adopted
The CLI SHALL provide a `baseline` command that adopts an existing
database: it produces the same first migration and snapshot `generate`
would, and marks that migration in its own banner as describing objects
that already exist and must be registered as applied rather than run.

`baseline` SHALL refuse unless the project has no migrations and an empty
snapshot, naming `generate` as what to run instead — a baseline is by
definition the first migration of an adopted database.

The emitted migration SHALL be an ordinary migration in every other
respect — same DDL, same banner hash chain — so `verify` accepts the
chain it starts and every later `generate` emits only what changed.

The command's report SHALL state the registration step explicitly, before
the user has a chance to run the file: running it against the database it
describes fails on its first statement, and "relation already exists" is
a poor way to learn that the file was never meant to be run.

Introspection — reading a live schema or a dump to write declarations —
is NOT part of this: the user writes the declarations, and confirming
they match the live schema stays a separate step.

#### Scenario: Adopting an existing database
- **WHEN** `hejbro baseline` runs on a project with declarations, no
  migrations and an empty snapshot
- **THEN** it writes one migration carrying the full DDL plus a
  `-- baseline:` banner line, writes the snapshot, and reports that the
  migration must be registered as applied without being run

#### Scenario: The chain a baseline starts is valid
- **WHEN** `hejbro verify` runs after a baseline
- **THEN** it passes — the baseline is chained and hashed exactly like
  any first migration

#### Scenario: The next change is an ordinary migration
- **WHEN** a declaration is added after a baseline and `hejbro generate`
  runs
- **THEN** the new migration contains only the added object, carries no
  baseline marker, and chains onto the baseline

#### Scenario: A baseline is refused on an existing chain
- **WHEN** `hejbro baseline` runs on a project that already has
  migrations or a non-empty snapshot
- **THEN** it fails with `baseline-not-first`, naming `hejbro generate`
  as the command for a change to an already-adopted project
